            <h3>About the project</h3> 
            <p>Waste Free is an app that helps users to become a better recycler. Target audience of this app is people
                    who want to do their part to protect the
                    environment by sorting waste correctly.
            </p> 
            <h3>Project duration</h3> 
            <p>July, 2021 - Aug, 2021</p>     
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>UX/UI Design, Competitive Audit, User Research, Prototyping, Usability Testing</p>
            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <p>Everyone buys groceries and orders food take-outs, but
                    sometimes it’s hard to tell which boxes or papers are
                    recyclable. Most of the audiences want to help protect the environment
                    but they don’t know how to do it efficiently.
            </p>
            <h3>Goal</h3>
            <p>This app will help users define their garbage type so that
                    they can sorting waste in the right way. Additionally, this
                    app lists volunteering opportunities, in which users can
                    easily register volunteering events both on desktop and
                    mobile. Eventually, help slow down global warming for
                    social good.

                <h4>User Research</h4>    
                <p>I conducted the unmoderated user research since it's during covid and I want our potential users to be safe at
                        home. Before the user research, I came up with all the ideas from Crazy Eight, and I thought users would have
                        loved, but after I got user research results and organized them into an insight, I noticed that most of the users
                        thought the user flow of the app is not very sufficient. There is so much information on the homepage that users
                        felt confused. So I changed the homepage to focus on one thing, which is the main feature of this app: To scan
                        and define your garbage type.

                <h4>Ideation</h4>
                <p>I did a quick ideation exercise to come up with
                        ideas for how to address the gaps
                        in the competitive audit. My focus
                        was specifically on identify waste
                        material and let use registering
                        volunteer opportunities.

                <p>After ideating and drafting some
                        paper wireframes, I created the initial
                        digital wireframes of this Waste Free
                        app.
                        These designs focused on smooth
                        user flow, helping users define their
                        garbage and registering an volunteer
                        event.

                        completed, I started work on
                        designing the responsive
                        website. I used this sitemap to
                        guide the organizational
                        structure of each screen’s
                        design to ensure a cohesive and
                        consistent experience across
                        devices.
