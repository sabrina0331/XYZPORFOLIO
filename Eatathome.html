            <h4 style="width: 94%; padding-top:3%;">To prove my assumption of offering a memorable food-eating experience in a new place by creating a family meal booking app, I created and sent out a survey. <span style="font-style: italic">Most people think it is a nice idea and will use the app.</span></h4>
            <p>I asked questions such as how frequently they travel? Will they eat local food during the trip? Will they make a reservation at a local restaurant beforehand? Share some unpleasant experiences when eating at a local restaurant? Will they use an app that allows them to book a family meal online?</p>

            <p  style="font-size: 1.8vw;">Thank you for watching my Case Study :) In this Case Study, I focused more on Visual Design, from coming up with the app idea to finishing a prototype. I pull together so much information and so many features adding to this app. Finally, I learned how important to optimize the app by applying the Design Principle to this app, and reducing users' cognitive load is essential for a design. </p>
            <h2 style="font-size: 3vw; padding-top: 3%;">Next Step</h2>
            <h3 style="font-size: 2vw;">Test the High-Fidelity Prototype before polishing the design</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 1.8vw; ">Since this case study, I focused on Visual Interface. For the next step, I will conduct a user interview to test the app, observe how users interact with the app, find out are there any other problems I need to solve, and iterate the design process.</p>
