        <h2>Discovery:</h2>
        <h3>Recycling is confusing and needs continuous effort. </h3>
        <p>When I am walking on the street and glance inside some street trash cans, I can easily see there are some plastic bottles or soda cans inside of them.
                Based on the EPA(the United States Environmental Protection Agency) reports, The total generation of MSW(Municipal Solid Waste) in 2018 was 292.4 million tons, 
                which was approximately 23.7 million tons more than the amount generated in 2017, the recycling rate is decreasing from 35% in 2017 to 32.1% in 2018.  Those statistics mean we create more waste that cannot be recycled or composed or we didn't recycle right.
                It's gratifying to see we made great efforts to Recycle Metal and Paper&Paperboard right. </p>
        <a href="images/project-recycle/landfill.png"><img style="width: 40%; margin: 4%;" src="images/project-recycle/landfill.png" alt="landfill"></a> <a href="images/project-recycle/recycle.png"><img style="width: 40%; margin: 4%;"  src="images/project-recycle/recycle.png" alt="recycle"></a>
        <p style="margin-top: -4em; font-size: .8em; color: grey; text-align: center;">Statistics & Images: EPA</p>
        <p>Recycling plastic is tricky, people usually think our Blue Recycling bin is a Magic Bin, whatever we throw it in, it will deliver to a factory, generate a new, clean bottle, and "TADA" we save the environment. But that is not
                how it works. Recycling takes a long process to collect, sort, screen, weigh and sell, so when we recycle contaminated bottles or cans, they cannot be sold, they will be released as a landfill. To increase the recycling rate, we need to utilize the process and recycle the right way.
        </p>

Because it has enabled some of the worst behavior I have ever seen.” - Kreigh Hampel</i> </h3>
        <h3>Why don't Americans recycle more often?</h3>
        <p>Covanta surveyed 2,000 Americans why people don't recycle revealed that a high percentage of respondents struggled when quizzed on whether or not different materials could be recycled. Reasons why Americans don't recycle more often.</p>

    <div class="recycle-often">
        <p>Lack of convenient access -- 39%</p>
        <p>Lack of space in my home for extra bins -- 35%</p>

    <div class="problem-statement">
        <h2>Identify the Problem: </h2>
        <h3>To better understand the problem and users' real needs, I did user research on Reddit and conducted user interviews with 5 people.</h3>
        <p>Based on my research and interview, I found that different states have different recycling policies and services. The majority of people who live in the downtown apartment do not have recycling services, people need to take more effort to recycle. I divided people into two groups: Group A is people who don't have recycle bin at home. Group B is people who have a recycle bin. </p>

        <h2>Reframe the Problem: </h2>
        <h3>People who recycle sometimes don't know which material is recyclable, and whether they recycled right.  People who don't have a recycle bin find it is hard to find a place that accepts recyclable materials.</h3>
        <h2>Goal:</h2>    
        <h3>Create an easy way to help people recycle better.</h3>
        <h2>Competitor Analysis:</h2>
        <h3>Conducted competitor analysis helps me to find the gaps between competirors and my Wastefree app.</h3>
        <p>I noticed the majority of people I interviewed, they had never used any recycle related apps. To see what type of features may help user in recycling and find the gaps, I searhced online and found three competitors.</p>
        <p><strong><i>iRecycle, Recycle Coach, Recycle!</i></strong> The core features of those three are on tracking recycling trucks and locating your nearby recycling bins. I dug into user's reviews from each app and found out the following:</p>

        <h3>Combining the User Problem and the Oppoutnitys may have, I decided to have four main features.</h3>
        <div class="core-features">
            <p>Scan to sort materials</p>
            <p>Educational articles and news</p>

            <p>Volunteering opportunities</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="ideate">
        <h2>Ideate</h2>
        <h3>I expanded more features of my app based on User research and competitor analysis.</h3>  
        <p>Because WasteFree focuses on finding an easier way to recycle better, I listed the features below as core features of this app, and I used Crazy 8's to sketch out app wireframes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Scan to sort waste:</strong> Save users time to figure out which material is recyclable without scanning through all sorting guide.</li>
            <li><strong>Save scanned results:</strong> Reinforce users to memorize the material next time.</li>
            <li><strong>Nearby Waste Disposable Center: </strong>Helps user to locate the recycling center and give directions on specific maps.</li>
            <li><strong>Recycling news:</strong> Helps users improve their sustainability and recycling rate.</li>
            <li><strong>Volunteering opportunity:</strong> Connects users with others to learn and recycle better in the future.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I drew 5 different Homepage wireframes and 3 after scan wireframes based on the result I got above, To make the best user-centered homepage, I highlight the features that should include in the app with "Red Stars" on each of the homepages, I'll combine those highlights to the final homepage.</p>

    <div class="low-wireframe">
        <h2>Wireframe</h2>
        <p>In order to create a easier way for users to recycle better by using this app, I created a User Flow with tasks that include: User gets sorting guide by scanning a material, User checks out articles (News), User registers a volunteering event, User finds a recycling center.</p>

Most of the interviewees think the navigation is clear, one of them think there are too much information on the homepage which is distracting. Here are some key findings during the interview: </p>

            <p>Users think the app overall is very easy to use and navigate such as identifying a material, finding a disposal center nearby, Recycling news and volunteering opportunities. The app is useful and educational, The color and typography made them feel fresh and environmental. When I asked Users to talk loud when using the app, I found out some contexts and features still confuse users. </p>

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <h3>What you think is not what the USERS think.</h3>
            <p>This is a very exciting application for me because I think recycling is a real issue we need to solve. This project helped me realize First, what a designer think is not what users think. Second, Sometimes what users say is not what they think. When I was doing user interviews, I observed how users interact with the app with given tasks, and I asked how they feel when finishing each task. For the final design, I combined both results from those interviews to refine users centered application.</p>
            <h2>Next Step</h2>
            <h3>Expand target audiences and Conduct more usability testing</h3>
            <p>Since I create this project based on my personal experience and my target audiences are very specific(people would like to recycle better), but to help realistic global warming problem, I need to expand the range of my target audience. Next step, I'll conduct another usability test and expand the range of my interviewees to see if this idea can reach more people's needs.</p>
