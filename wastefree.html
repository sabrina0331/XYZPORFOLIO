            <h3>People feel challenged to recycle not only at a food court but also at home.</h3>
            <p>Due to a family visit to San Francisco, I spent a week in downtown SF. I observed that the building where I was staying near Union Square, even has two separate trash chutes(recycle and waste), but I still can see people throwing to-go boxes in the waste chute. As Global Warming continues year after year.  I want to find out what challenges people to recycle. </p>

            <p>Based on my experience, I came up with some hypotheses that why people don't recycle. What challenges do they face? What are the goals do I want to accomplish.</p>
            <h3>Challenges:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>People don't want to waste time on sorting waste.</li>
                    <li>No one tells them whether they do it right or wrong.</li>

            <ul>

                <li><strong>Nearby Waste Disposable Center: </strong>Helps user to locate the recycling center and give directions on specific maps.</li>
                <li><strong>Recycling news:</strong> Helps users improve their sustainability and recycling rate.</li>

            <h2>What I learned</h2>
            <h3>What you think is not what the USERS think.</h3>
            <p>This is a very exciting application for me because I think recycling is a real issue we need to solve. This project helped me realize First, what a designer think is not what users think. Second, Sometimes what users say is not what they think. So when I was doing user interviews, I observed how users interact with the app with given tasks, and I asked how they feel when finishing each task. For the final design, I combined both results from those interviews to refine users centered application.</p>
            <h2>Next Step</h2>
            <h3>Take a Data-Driven approach to UX Design</h3>
            <p>Since I create this project based on my personal experience and my target audiences are very specific(people would like to recycle better), but to help realistic global warming problem, I need to expand the range of my target audience. Next step, I'll conduct another usability test and expand the range of my interviewees to see if this idea can reach more people's needs.</p>
