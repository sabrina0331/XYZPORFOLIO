            <p class="context">I always define myself as a creative person :)
                    I love drawing, handcrafting and often come up with crazy ideas.  
                    I like traveling and hiking. The most interesting place I have been to is 
                    Orleans, Louisiana. I love their historical buildings,
                    jazz music everywhere, and people’s lifestyles. 
                    
                    I love animals, and I am a cat-mom of a 13-year-old kitty “MiMi”.  
                    One of my dreams is to visit Tanzania Safari to see the Great Migration. 
                    Global warming is real, I am doing my part to protect the planet, 
                    but it’s not enough so that I came up with the idea of the “WasteFree” app, 
                    educating people about sorting waste.
                    
                    At work, my colleagues usually called me a  responsible and hard-working teammate.
